# TypeScript Short-Term Plan

1. Learn basic types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) and write simple `.ts` files.  
2. Practice functions with typed parameters and return values.  
3. Understand interfaces, type aliases, and how to structure objects.  
4. Learn classes, access modifiers, and inheritance.  
5. Build a small project using everything I learned.
