# VS Code Basics Setup & Workflow Notes

## What I Learned

These are simple things that help me use VS Code more easily and keep my code clean.

### 1. Useful Shortcuts

1. **Search in Files (`Ctrl + Shift + F`):** Lets me find anything in my project without clicking around.
2. **Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`):** Opens a menu where I can type any command, like “Format Document.”
3. **Toggle Terminal (`` Ctrl + ` ``):** Opens the built-in terminal so I don’t have to switch to another window.
4. **Add Selection to Next Match (`Ctrl + D`):** Selects the next occurrence of the currently highlighted word so I can edit multiple matches at once.
5. **Add Cursor Below (`Ctrl + Alt + Down`):** Places an extra cursor on the line below, allowing me to type or edit multiple lines simultaneously.

### 2. Important Settings

1. `"editor.formatOnSave": true`
   VS Code automatically fixes formatting each time I save.

2. `"editor.tabSize": 2`
   Makes indentation clean and readable.

3. `"files.autoSave": "onFocusChange"`
   Saves my file when I switch to another tab or window.

### 3. Helpful Extensions

1. **Prettier – Code Formatter**
   Formats my code the same way every time.

2. **Remote – SSH**
   Lets me open and edit files on my cloud server just like they were on my own computer.
